# MCBR
A datapack that turns minecraft into a battle royale game

the datapack should be played for version 1.17.1

BASICS:

use "/function br:gamestart" to start the game
use "/function br:gamestop" to stop the game
use "/team join {team} {player}" to join players to teams (this is needed) (teams can consist of one member)

when the game starts all teams spawn at diffrent locations of the 1000x1000 map
there is also a 100 barrels with loot all around the map
after 2 minutes the map starts shrinking 2 block per second until it becomes 1x1
after 11 minutes the game automatically stops

the las team alive wins!

have fun!
